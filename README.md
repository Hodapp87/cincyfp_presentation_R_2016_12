# cincyfp_presentation_R_2016_12

This contains material from a presentation for a talk on R that I
delivered
to
[CincyFP](https://cincyfp.wordpress.com/2016/11/29/december-meeting-5/) on
December 13, 2016.

Presentation slides
are
[here](https://hodapple.com/blag/assets_external/2016-12-13-cincyfp-r-crosspost/CincyFP_R_slides.slides.html).
Note that as it's using [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/),
pressing the `s` key will create a second window showing notes, next
slide, timer, and clock.
(That's
[CincyFP_R_demo.slides.html](https://github.com/Hodapp87/cincyfp_presentation_R_2016_12/blob/master/CincyFP_R_slides.slides.html) on
GitHub, but GitHub doesn't seem to be able to render HTML from a
repo.)

The [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook to produce those slides is
in
[CincyFP_R_slides.ipynb](https://github.com/Hodapp87/cincyfp_presentation_R_2016_12/blob/master/CincyFP_R_slides.ipynb).
[slides.sh](https://github.com/Hodapp87/cincyfp_presentation_R_2016_12/blob/master/slides.sh) will
re-render the HTML.

Code written live during the talk is
in
[Live_demo.ipynb](https://github.com/Hodapp87/cincyfp_presentation_R_2016_12/blob/master/Live_demo.ipynb).

Another copy is
on
[CincyFP's GitHub](https://github.com/cincy-functional-programmers/cincyfp-presentations).
